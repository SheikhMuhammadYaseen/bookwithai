Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing intelligent agents that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI, which often operates in purely digital environments, Physical AI is embodied in systems like robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles.

### Key Characteristics: {#ch1-sec1-char}

*   **Embodiment**: Physical AI systems have a physical body, allowing them to interact directly with their environment through sensors and actuators.
*   **Perception**: They use sensors (like cameras, LiDAR, and IMU) to gather information about the world around them.
*   **Action**: They use actuators (like motors and grippers) to perform actions and affect change in their environment.
*   **Reasoning**: They process sensory information and use AI algorithms to make decisions and plan actions to achieve their goals.

This book will explore the fundamental concepts, technologies, and applications of Physical AI, with a focus on humanoid robotics.
