# Chapter 2: Sensors and Actuators in Robotics

## 2.1 The Role of Sensors {#ch2-sec1-role-of-sensors}

Sensors are the sensory organs of a robot, providing the crucial data it needs to perceive and understand its environment. Without sensors, a robot is essentially blind and deaf, unable to interact with the world in a meaningful way. This section will explore the vital role that sensors play in the field of robotics.

## 2.2 Common Types of Sensors {#ch2-sec2-common-sensors}

There is a vast array of sensors available for use in robotics, each with its own unique capabilities and applications. Some of the most common types include:

*   **LIDAR:** (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors use lasers to create detailed 3D maps of the environment.
*   **Cameras:** Provide visual data, allowing robots to "see" and interpret their surroundings.
*   **IMUs:** (Inertial Measurement Units) measure a robot's orientation and angular velocity, which is essential for balance and navigation.

## 2.3 Actuators: Enabling Movement and Interaction {#ch2-sec3-actuators}

If sensors are the senses of a robot, then actuators are its muscles. Actuators are the components that enable a robot to move and interact with its environment. They convert electrical energy into physical motion.

## 2.4 Motors and Servos {#ch2-sec4-motors-servos}

The most common type of actuator used in robotics is the electric motor. There are many different types of motors, each suited for different applications. Servos, for example, are a special type of motor that allows for precise control over position, velocity, and acceleration.

## Exercises {#ch2-sec5-exercises}

### Exercise 1: Sensor Identification {#ch2-sec5-ex1}

1.  For each of the following tasks, identify the most appropriate type of sensor to use:
    *   Navigating a cluttered room.
    *   Identifying a specific person's face.
    *   Maintaining balance while walking on two legs.

### Exercise 2: Actuator Selection {#ch2-sec5-ex2}

Imagine you are designing a robotic arm that needs to be able to pick up and move delicate objects with a high degree of precision. What type of actuator would you choose for this application, and why?
