# Chapter 8: Isaac Perception and Control Pipelines

## 8.1 Introduction to Perception Pipelines {#ch8-sec1-intro-to-perception}

A perception pipeline is a series of steps that a robot takes to process sensor data and extract meaningful information about its environment. This is a crucial part of any autonomous system, as it allows the robot to "see" and "understand" the world around it.

## 8.2 Building a Perception Pipeline in Isaac Sim {#ch8-sec2-building-pipeline}

Isaac Sim provides a powerful set of tools for building and testing perception pipelines. This section will show you how to use the Isaac Sim editor to create a simple perception pipeline that can be used to detect objects in the environment.

## 8.3 Introduction to Control Pipelines {#ch8-sec3-intro-to-control}

A control pipeline is a series of steps that a robot takes to process information and generate motor commands. This is what allows a robot to move and interact with its environment.

## 8.4 Building a Control Pipeline in Isaac Sim {#ch8-sec4-building-control-pipeline}

Isaac Sim can also be used to build and test control pipelines. This section will show you how to create a simple control pipeline that can be used to make a robot follow a moving object.

## Exercises {#ch8-sec5-exercises}

### Exercise 1: Pipeline Pro {#ch8-sec5-ex1}

1.  What is a perception pipeline?
2.  What is a control pipeline?
3.  How can Isaac Sim be used to build and test perception and control pipelines?

### Exercise 2: Pipeline Challenge {#ch8-sec5-ex2}

Follow the instructions in the "Building a Perception Pipeline in Isaac Sim" and "Building a Control Pipeline in Isaac Sim" sections to create your own perception and control pipelines. Take a screenshot of your robot following a moving object in the Isaac Sim environment.
