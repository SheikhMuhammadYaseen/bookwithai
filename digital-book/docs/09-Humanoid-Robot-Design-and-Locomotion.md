# Chapter 9: Humanoid Robot Design and Locomotion

## 9.1 Introduction to Humanoid Robots {#ch9-sec1-intro-to-humanoids}

Humanoid robots are robots that are designed to resemble the human body. They are one of the most complex and challenging types of robots to build, but they also have the potential to be the most versatile. This section will provide an overview of the field of humanoid robotics and discuss some of the key challenges that researchers are facing.

## 9.2 The Anatomy of a Humanoid Robot {#ch9-sec2-anatomy-of-humanoid}

This section will delve into the anatomy of a humanoid robot. We will discuss the different components that make up a humanoid robot, such as the head, torso, arms, and legs. We will also discuss the different types of sensors and actuators that are used in humanoid robots.

## 9.3 Humanoid Locomotion {#ch9-sec3-humanoid-locomotion}

One of the biggest challenges in humanoid robotics is locomotion. This section will discuss the different gaits that are used by humanoid robots, such as walking, running, and jumping. We will also discuss the different control strategies that are used to achieve stable locomotion.
