# Chapter 10: Humanoid Control and Motion Planning

## 10.1 Introduction to Humanoid Control {#ch10-sec1-intro-to-humanoid-control}

Humanoid control is the process of generating the motor commands that are needed to make a humanoid robot move in a desired way. This is a very complex task, as it involves coordinating the movement of many different joints and maintaining the robot's balance.

## 10.2 Whole-Body Control {#ch10-sec2-whole-body-control}

Whole-body control is a control strategy that is used to coordinate the movement of all of the joints in a humanoid robot. This is a very powerful technique that can be used to generate complex and dynamic movements.

## 10.3 Motion Planning for Humanoid Robots {#ch10-sec3-motion-planning}

Motion planning is the process of finding a path for a robot to move from a starting point to a goal point without colliding with any obstacles. This is a very challenging problem for humanoid robots, as they have a large number of degrees of freedom.

## 10.4 Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Control {#ch10-sec4-reinforcement-learning}

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that can be used to learn control policies for humanoid robots. This is a very promising area of research, as it has the potential to create robots that can learn to move in a more natural and human-like way.

## Exercises {#ch10-sec5-exercises}

### Exercise 1: Control Concepts {#ch10-sec5-ex1}

1.  What is whole-body control?
2.  What is motion planning?
3.  How can reinforcement learning be used for humanoid control?

### Exercise 2: Motion Planning Challenge {#ch10-sec5-ex2}

Imagine you are a motion planner for a humanoid robot. Your goal is to find a path for the robot to walk from one side of a cluttered room to the other. Describe the steps you would take to solve this problem.
