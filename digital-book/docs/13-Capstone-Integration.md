# Chapter 13: Capstone Integration

## 13.1 Introduction to Capstone Projects {#ch13-sec1-intro-to-capstone}

A capstone project is a culminating academic experience that allows students to demonstrate their mastery of a particular subject area. In the context of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, a capstone project involves integrating all of the knowledge and skills that you have acquired throughout this book to build a functional robot or simulation.

## 13.2 Project Planning and Design {#ch13-sec2-project-planning}

The first step in any capstone project is planning and design. This section will guide you through the process of defining your project goals, selecting appropriate hardware and software, and creating a detailed project plan.

## 13.3 Implementation and Testing {#ch13-sec3-implementation-testing}

Once you have a solid plan, you can begin to implement your project. This section will provide you with some tips and best practices for implementing and testing your robot or simulation. We will also discuss some common challenges that you may encounter and how to overcome them.

## 13.4 Project Presentation and Documentation {#ch13-sec4-presentation-documentation}

The final step in any capstone project is to present your work and document your findings. This section will provide you with some tips for creating a compelling presentation and writing a clear and concise project report.

## Exercises {#ch13-sec5-exercises}

### Exercise 1: Project Proposal {#ch13-sec5-ex1}

Imagine you are at the beginning of your capstone project. Write a detailed project proposal that includes your project goals, hardware and software selection, and a high-level project plan.

### Exercise 2: Debugging Scenario {#ch13-sec5-ex2}

During the implementation of your capstone project, you encounter a bug where your robot is not moving as expected. Describe the steps you would take to debug this issue.
