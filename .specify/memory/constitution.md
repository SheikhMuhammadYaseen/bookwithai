# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Learning Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Comprehensive Content
The platform must cover all core topics from the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, including concepts, ROS2, sensors, URDF, simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, humanoid design, perception, and planning.

### II. Structured Learning
Content must be organized into a clear hierarchy of chapters and subchapters, presented through a navigable website structure with a sidebar for easy access.

### III. Interactivity and Engagement
The platform must include features for user engagement, such as interactive diagrams, code challenges, and a Virtual Learning Assistant. Placeholders for features like "Ask AI", "Translate to Urdu", and "Personalize" must be incorporated from the start.

### IV. Discoverability and Integration
Every chapter and subchapter must contain appropriate metadata to support future embedding, search, and retrieval functionalities.

### V. Real-World Application
The content must be grounded in practical application, featuring exercises, labs, code snippets, and real-world examples to reinforce learning.

## Content Standards

All content must be well-written, technically accurate, and accompanied by relevant diagrams, code examples, and interactive elements where appropriate. Each section should be a self-contained learning module.

## Technology Stack

The project will be built using Docusaurus for the website framework and Spec-Kit Plus for managing the development lifecycle (specs, plans, tasks).

## Governance

This constitution is the authoritative source for all project principles. All development work, from planning to implementation, must align with these principles. Amendments require a formal proposal and review to ensure they align with the project's educational goals.
